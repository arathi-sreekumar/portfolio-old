  <h1><a href="http://www.semantico.com/" target="_blank">Semantico Ltd</a></h1>
  <p class="paragraph">I joined Semantico on August 5th 2013 as a frontend developer.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I worked across multiple projects for clients such as McGraw Hill Education, Society of Petroleus Engineers and Dawson Era developing responsive, accessible websites using technologies such as backbone.js, require.js and handlebar.js.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">During my tenure I have been able to pick up new projects and work on new technologies with ease and deliver quality work on time. I have also shown ownership for my work and have been able to manage my time efficiently and prioritize work as needed.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://www.amadeus.com/" target="_blank">Amadeus Software Labs India Pvt Ltd</a></h1>
  <p class="paragraph">I joined Amadeus on June 29th 2012 as part of a transfer in ownership of the Amadeus Labs contract team from Ness to Amadeus to be a part of Amadeus&apos;s own development center in Bangalore.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I continued in the AirCanada Website Project, with an appraised position as Senior Software Engineer, and an exceptional bonus offer and a revised pay scale.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">During my tenure I worked on several critical changes such as revamping the seat selection page, changing the rebooking page flows, mediaplex tag changes, adding new baggage rules to name a few. I also helped train the new joinees and gave sessions on domain, process and tools related to the project.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I left Amadeus on 17th October 2012, when I got married and relocated to UK.</p>

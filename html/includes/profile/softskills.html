  <h1>Soft Skills</h1>
  <p>Everybody claims they have got the perfect inter personal skills, and its a list generally ignored. So I am going to claim mine through a few real life examples on why I possess them.</p>
  <h2>Comprehensive problem solving abilities</h2>
  <p>This can only be checked by throwing me a problem, which I can attempt to solve. You could give me a test and if I manage to solve it I guess I pass!</p>
  <h2>Excellent verbal and written communication skills</h2>
  <p>All this copy is an example of my written communication skills, which should speak for itself. As to my verbal skills, an interview should solve the problem.</p>
  <h2>Excellent inter personal skills</h2>
  <p>In context to work environment, my policy is that of give and take. I try and provide assistence where required, and hope to recieve the same. I tend to interact with most of my coworkers and you could probably ask any of my old colleagues!</p>
  <h2>Quick learner with a natural aptitude for programming</h2>
  <p>I have managed to own work I have been dropped in the center of in relatively short amount of time, and have a consistent feedback from my peers/ team leads that I did so. But you could always confirm this from my colleagues.</p>
  <h2>Willingness to learn and a hard worker</h2>
  <p>I tend to take ownership of a work assigned to me and always try to give it the best I could, and plan the work and time efficiently. And in the past year I have learned more than the previous, and a not knowing something doesnt phase me. I am confident in my abilities to learn it quickly.</p>
  <h2>Good team facilitator</h2>
  <p>I like to work in a team. I believe the key to getting things done efficiently in a team is not to squabble over what is or isn't my responsibilty, not go into blame games, and to be open to suggestions or alternate solutions from your peers. Doing whats best for the project and not being defensive about mistakes help too.</p>

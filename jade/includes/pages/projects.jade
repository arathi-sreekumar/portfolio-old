        a(href="http://content.iospress.com/", target="_blank") IOS Press
    p IOS press work was a minimum viable project done in an extremely short time, due to pressing needs for the client. In spite of the short timeframe, we were able to create a stable, moderately resposive (since 90% of the users were desktop users, this had a lower priority), accessible website, with GA tracking. I was one of the two frontend developers on this project.
